This repository is set up to document my journey studying machine learning until I achieve mastery (hopefully!). Currently it only contains from-scratch implementations of different models, but I think I will expand it to discuss other topics.

TODO:
- SVM (read https://see.stanford.edu/materials/aimlcs229/cs229-notes3.pdf)
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Multinomial Logistic Regression (Softmax Regression) (this is multiclass!)
- Newton-cg solver
- lbfgs solver
- liblinear solver
- sag solver
- saga solver
