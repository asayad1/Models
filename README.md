This repository is set up to document my journey studying machine learning until I achieve mastery (hopefully!). Currently it only contains from-scratch implementations of different models, but I think I will expand it to discuss other topics.

TODO:
- Multinomial Logistic Regression (Softmax Regression) (this is multiclass!)
- Newton-cg solver
- lbfgs solver
- liblinear solver
- sag solver
- saga solver
- Read these lecture notes on bias-variance definition: https://sebastianraschka.com/pdf/lecture-notes/stat451fs20/08-model-eval-1-intro__notes.pdf
